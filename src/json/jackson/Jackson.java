/**
 * Jackson - Java JSON Processor Jackson is a JSON processor. It provides JSON
 * parser/JSON generator as foundational building block; and adds a powerful
 * Databinder (JSON<->POJO) and Tree Model as optional add-on blocks. This means
 * that you can read and write JSON either as stream of tokens (Streaming API),
 * as Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs, databind) or as Trees (Tree Model).
 * 
 * Jackson is:
 * 1) FAST (measured to be faster than any other Java json parser and data binder) 
 * 2) Streaming (reading, writing) 
 * 3) Zero-dependency (does not rely on other packages beyond JDK) 
 * 4) Powerful (full data binding for common JDK classes as well as any Java bean class, Collection, Map or Enum), Configurable 
 * 5) Open Source
 * 
 * 
 * Write Example NO
 * @see JsonPrettyPrint.java

Can you list serialization methods?
Serialization interface does not have any methods. It is a marker interface. It just tells the JVM that your class can be serializable.

How to ignore json empty or null values using Jackson API in java?

In this example you will know how to ignore json empty or null values using jackson API. All you need to do is add @JsonInclude annotation to the class. how to use @JsonPropertyOrder annotation. If you want to exclude null values, use @JsonInclude annotation with Include.NON_NULL value as shown below:

Note: Refer How to convert Java object to JSON string? page for dependent libraries.

?
1
@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)
If you want to exclude empty values, use @JsonInclude annotation with Include.NON_EMPTY value as shown below:

?
1
@JsonInclude(Include.NON_EMPTY)

Jackson is a High-performance JSON processor Java library. In this tutorial, we show you how to use Jackson’s data binding to convert Java object to / from JSON.

For object/json conversion, you need to know following two methods :

//1. Convert Java object to JSON format
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.writeValue(new File("c:\\user.json"), user);
//2. Convert JSON to Java object
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
User user = mapper.readValue(new File("c:\\user.json"), User.class);
Note
Both writeValue() and readValue() has many overloaded methods to support different type of inputs and outputs. Make sure check it out.

1. Jackson Dependency
Jackson contains 6 separate jars for different purpose, check here. In this case, you only need “jackson-mapper-asl” to handle the conversion, just declares following dependency in your pom.xml

Note
Above JSON output is hard to read. You can enhance it by enable the pretty print feature.*/
